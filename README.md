Generative Algorithmic Compositional Software Tool for Random Orchestrated Music
 
Platform for generating musical material. Allows users to code own music 'generators' via Generator object inheritance, and thus implement existing or new music generating algorithms. Sample generators included are 'Serialism', 'Per Norgard' (infinity series) and 'MelodyGen'. Mutator objects are used for mutating previously generated data. Composition takes place through use of high-level scripting language. Includes support for Open Sound Control (OSC) for sound rendering (see also SuperCollider demonstration file).
